# 📚 Data Enigine Thinking Book Errata & Issues

Please submit corrections by editing the [`errata.md`](./ERRATA.md) markdown file.

For any questions, when in doubt, or more detailed conversations please create an issue via Github.

## How it works - via Github

1. Click **`errata.md` → ✏️ Edit (pencil icon)** on GitHub.
2. **Copy the template** below and paste it at the **bottom** of the file under **`## Open reports`**.
3. Fill in the fields (page/chapter, what you saw vs. expected, suggested fix).
4. **Commit changes** → open a **Pull Request**.
5. A maintainer will triage and merge; once fixed, the item is moved to **`## Resolved`**.

> Prefer issues instead? Use the **“New errata”** issue form (optional) — it will remind you of the same fields. But the primary workflow is **PRs to `ERRATA.md`**.

## Why one Markdown file?

* Keeps contribution super simple — no tooling, no cloning required.
* Easy to browse all open items in one place.
* Every change is reviewed via PRs.
